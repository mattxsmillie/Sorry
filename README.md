# Sorry
Sorry is a mock up of the Sorry! Board Game, by Hasbro. It creates observations of where a single peice might be in a game at a given turn and writes these observations to a csv file for analysis in statistical software such as R.

Sorry consists of one board, with spaces all around and a start space and a home space for Green.
It has a Deck which is shuffled and which cards are drawn from to generate the outcomes.
As it is currently, Sorry is only funcitional with one peice.
