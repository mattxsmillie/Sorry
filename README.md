# Sorry
Sorry is a mock up of the Sorry! Board Game, by Hasbro. It creates observations of where a single peice might be in a game at a given turn and writes these observations to a csv file for analysis in statistical software such as R.

Sorry consists of one board, with spaces all around and a start space and a home space for Green.
It has a Deck which is shuffled and which cards are drawn from to generate the outcomes.
As it is currently, Sorry is only funcitional with one peice. 

Sorry was originally made as part of a project for Modern Applications of Discrete Mathematics, a class at Carroll College. The project members are Matthew Smillie and Trevor Drinville.
